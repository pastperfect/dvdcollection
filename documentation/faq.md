- Genres
- Box set names
- Production companies

### Q: Can multiple people use the same collection?
**A:** The application is designed for single-user use, but:
- Multiple people can access the same installation
- No user authentication by default
- All users share the same collection data
- For multi-user needs, consider Django's built-in user system

### Q: Can I access this from outside my home network?
**A:** For security reasons, the default setup only allows local access. For external access:
- Configure your router for port forwarding
- Set up proper security measures
- Consider using a VPN instead
- See the [Deployment Guide](deployment.md) for production setup

- **Templates**: Edit HTML files in `templates/`
- **Bootstrap theme**: Replace the Bootstrap CSS
- **Logo/branding**: Update images and text

### Q: Can I add custom fields?
**A:** This requires Django knowledge:
1. Modify the `DVD` model in `models.py`
2. Create and run migrations
3. Update forms and templates
4. See the [Development Guide](development.md) for details

### Q: Can I integrate with other services?
**A:** The application is designed to be extensible:
- Add new API services to `services.py`
- Create new views and URLs
- Extend the existing models
- Follow Django best practices for extensions

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Q: The server won't start
**A:** Check:

### Q: I see a "500 Internal Server Error"
**A:**
1. Check the console output for error details
2. Ensure `DEBUG=True` in your `.env` file (development only)
3. Verify database permissions
4. Check that all migrations are applied

### Q: Movies aren't saving properly
**A:**
1. **Database permissions**: Ensure write access to `db.sqlite3`
2. **Form validation**: Check for required field errors
3. **API connectivity**: Verify TMDB API access
4. **Disk space**: Ensure sufficient space for database growth

### Q: Bulk operations are failing
**A:**
1. **API rate limits**: Wait between operations
2. **Large datasets**: Process smaller batches
3. **Network timeouts**: Check internet connectivity
4. **Memory issues**: Restart the server between large operations

## üí° Best Practices

### Q: What's the best way to organize a large collection?
**A:**
1. **Use consistent naming**: Establish patterns for storage boxes
2. **Leverage filters**: Use search and filtering instead of browsing
3. **Regular maintenance**: Update disposed items promptly
4. **Backup frequently**: Export data regularly
5. **Use box sets**: Group related movies for easier management

### Q: How should I handle different editions?
**A:**
- **Same movie, different formats**: Use media type field
- **Director's cuts, etc.**: Add as separate entries
- **Region variants**: Note in storage box or manually in overview
- **Chronological releases**: Use release year to distinguish

### Q: What's the workflow for disposed items?
**A:**
1. **Before disposal**: Change status to "Disposed"
2. **Clear storage box**: Remove physical location
3. **Keep records**: Maintain for collection history
4. **Export lists**: Generate "wanted" lists for re-acquisition
